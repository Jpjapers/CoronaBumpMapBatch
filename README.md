# CoronaBumpMapBatch
A Maxscript to adjust the bump values of all Corona Physical and legacy materials in a scene

Sometimes Megascans Bridge likes to import objects and materials into corona with the bump value set to 99.
This script enables you to iterate through all Corona Physical and Corona Legacy materials in your scene and set the bump values to 1 from 99.

You can edit the values within the script to change to whatever you need.
